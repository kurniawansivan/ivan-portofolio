                    I build the high-performance digital engines that power modern applications. My craft is clean,
                    scalable backend architecture using Python, FastAPI, and Docker.

                <p>A great backend is the start, not the end. My expertise lies in building solid foundations with
                    <b>Python</b>, <b>FastAPI</b>, and <b>PostgreSQL</b>, but my curiosity doesn't stop at the API
                    endpoint.
                </p>
                <p>I'm driven to understand the complete product lifecycle. That's why I'm actively expanding into
                    <b>Vue</b> for the frontend, <b>Flutter</b> for mobile, and the analytical power of <b>Data
                        Science</b> building the skills to not only build the product, but to understand its impact.
